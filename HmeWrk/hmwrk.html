<p>Dear Stan,</p>
<p>I'm writing to tell you about software development class.</p>
<h1>This line was made in a header tag h1, it catches the attention of the reader as an important heading.</h1>
<h2>See this is h2 and less bolder,see?</h2>
<p>There's so much more you can do with these elements, thats what they are called.</p>
<img src = '2.jpg' alt = 'A picture from Bing' width = '150' height = '150' align = 'right'>
<b><ins>Hello</ins></b>
<em>hello</em>
<big>hello</big>
<i>hello</i>
<small>hello</small>
<strong>hello</strong>
2<sub>2</sub>
2<sup>2</sup>
<ins>hello</ins>
<del>hello</del>
<input>email</input>

<p>I can do all the above and more.<br>
I know its all scattered right now but it will improve.<br>
Most elements have opening and closing tags.I have to go, will update you as I progress
</p> 

<p align = 'right'>Your friend,<br>Francis.</p>
